            <p>The delta variant, first discoverd in India, was the main cause behind subcontinent's intense COVID numbers this past spring. Studies show that this variant is probably the most transmissible of the main four "variants of concern". It is highly recommended by the CDC to wear your mask if you are not vaccinated. Individuals fully vaccinated have shown to still have near full effectiveness for no risk of hospitalization against the variant, although they can still contract it and spread it with uncertainty of how minimized this is.</p>

            <p>The alpha variant, first identified in the UK, is believed to be 50% more transmissible from person to person than the original coronavirus strain. Causing a surge of cases in the UK in the fall of 2020, the alpha variant has been the dominant variant in the US for most of this past year, but it is soon to be taken over by the delta variant. The alpha variant sspreads MUCH faster than other variants which is why it is a big concern. The three FDA-approved vaccines do work against this variant to nearly eliminate risk of hospitilzation, severe illness, and death. Wearing masks if not fully vaccinated is strongly recommended.</p>
